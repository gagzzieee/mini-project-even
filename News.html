          <h2>Get Ready For Futures Nordiac Talents.</h2>
          <p>Copenhagen Photo Festival has been invited as a partner for the 4th edition of the FUTURES, a platform co-funded by the Creative Europe Programme of the European Union focusing on amplifying emerging talents in photography in Europe.

Since 2017, FUTURES has been offering a full programme to increase the capacity, mobility and visibility to various artists selected every year by leading art institutions across Europe.

The programme will start in January 2021, with a one-month open call for upcoming and recent graduates of art or documentary photography with Nordic residency. .</p>

          <h2>Good bye, Europe</h2>
          <p>Since 2018, Copenhagen Photo Festival has been part of the Creative Europe co-funded project Reconstruction of Identities together with three other partners, all working within the field of photography and visual culture.

          <h2>We are looking for interns for Winters 2021</h2>
          <p>COPENHAGEN PHOTO FESTIVALS vision is to strengthen our ability to interpret the photography as an artform. We work the whole year to convey and set in motion initiatives about the photography with the festival being the high point of the year. In 2021 the festival will run from the 3rd-13th of June, and we are now looking for interns, who can offer professionalism, opinions and excitement!

We are a small organisation with an informal work environment, located in Villa Kultur on Østerbro. As an intern you will have influence on the realization of a comprehensive culture event with a big number og collaborators and a broad range of activities. During your internship you will get experience with both event- and exhibition work, and you will be taught to be in charge of independent projects going foward. You will put your academic knowledge and education to use with assignments in a practical and creative context. You get a broad insight into the photo- and artworld as well as the cultural environment on an  international level.</p>
